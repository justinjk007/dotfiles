#+CAPTION: This is how I feel when I tweak my emacs config
#+html: <p align="center"><img src="fluff/usingemacs.gif" /></p>

* Install [[https://git-scm.com/downloads][git]] first
- You have to move =.gitconfig= manually and set appropriate name for
  the machine, this is only done once for that machine anyways.
- If =magit= suddenly stops working on windows, run this on =cmd=

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  git config --global credential.helper wincred
  #+END_SRC

* This is a repository for my config files
 Here you can find my
- Emacs configuration
- Custom functions I have written and collected for emacs
- My CS:GO autoexec config
- My git configuration
- My snippets - Usable with [[https://github.com/joaotavora/yasnippet][YASnippets]]
- A small script in vbs to start emacs daemon during startup
  completely hiding the console window for windows.
- My shell aliases
- KeyBoard Config for the *K70 RGB* Keyboard

* Setup
Get [[https://www.dropbox.com/downloading][Dropbox]], since agenda file is located in there, emacs will bug you
if it can't find it. After logging in and syncing all you contents set
*DROPBOX_DIR* to point to the root of Dropbox directory.

Since generally some environment varibles are specific to the machine,
edit file:./lisp/machine-specific.el and move it to =~= directory
manually, this is only done once really.

- For Linux
  - If you have a Linux system good to go install emacs, run the =copy.sh=
    file and take a break when emacs does work for you.
  - Emacs daemon can be run as service, =copy.sh= copies the service file

- For windows
  - Move =wifi-on-off.vbs= to startup folder, only do this if you have a
    desktop and you are using a wi-fi still and you want to play CS:GO
    with a good ping.
  - Install [[http://www.corsair.com/en-us/downloads][CUE]] for managing your keyboard profiles and import
    =K70_CUE2.cuefolder=.
  - Remember the paths in the registry files should be changed to the correct paths before adding them,
    you might even break windows without doing that.
  - To pin emacsclient on the taskbar, run =runemacs.exe=, pin it to taskbar, change
    properties. This will emacs daemon on the first click and start a client, if the daemon is
    running start the client
    - Target to ="C:\Program Files (x86)\GNU Emacs\bin\emacsclientw.exe" -c -a ""=
    - Start in directory ="C:\Program Files (x86)\GNU Emacs\bin"=

- For OS X
  - Install [[https://brew.sh][Brew]].
  - Install Aspell from brew using =brew install aspell=
  - Install emacs from https://emacsformacosx.com/
  - Run the =copy.sh=


PS: To get to the startup folder on windows open the run window
(Windows button + R) and write =shell:startup=.

* Environment variables to be added
- *DROPBOX_DIR*, should point to the root of Dropbox
  like =D:\Dropbox=
- *FLUTTER_ROOT*, should point to the root of flutter sdk path
  like =D:\Dev\flutter=
* Other softwares to install

- Python
  #+begin_src sh
  pip install 'python-language-server[all]' # for lsp support
   #+end_src
- [[https://sourceforge.net/projects/ezwinports/files/][Hunspell]]- Try and match this install path
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (add-to-list 'exec-path "c:/Program Files (x86)/Hunspell/bin/")
  #+END_SRC
- [[https://www.ledger-cli.org/download.html][ledger-cli]]
- [[https://github.com/IBM/plex/releases][IBM Plex fonts]]
- [[https://github.com/domtronn/all-the-icons.el/tree/master/fonts][All the fonts]]
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; On linux this can easily done by calling
  (all-the-icons-install-fonts)
  #+end_src
- [[https://miktex.org/][MiKTEX]]
- [[http://releases.llvm.org/download.html][LLVM-ToolChain]]

Add everything to *PATH* off-course
